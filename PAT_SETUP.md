# Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

Follow these steps to create a Personal Access Token for pushing code to GitHub:

1. Go to GitHub.com and sign in
2. Click your profile picture in the top-right corner
3. Select "Settings"
4. Scroll down to "Developer settings" (at the bottom of the left sidebar)
5. Click "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"
6. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
7. For "Note", enter: "DeepSeek Coding Agent Replit"
8. Set expiration to your preference (e.g., 30 days)
9. Under "Select scopes", check:
   - ✓ repo (all repo-related permissions)
10. Click "Generate token"
11. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately! You won't be able to see it again.

After you have your token, we'll use it to authenticate. When Git asks for a password, use this token instead.

Let me know once you have generated and copied your Personal Access Token, and I'll help you push the code using it.
