## Bug Report: Agent Misinterprets User Selection and Takes Opposite Action

### Bug Description
The agent presented numbered options to the user regarding WebSocket tests, but when the user explicitly selected option 1 ("Keep the tests disabled"), the agent incorrectly interpreted this as a request to re-enable the tests - the exact opposite of what was chosen.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Agent presented multiple options regarding WebSocket tests
2. User explicitly selected option 1: "Keep the tests disabled (current state) and focus on implementing other core functionality first"
3. Agent responded with: "I understand you'd like me to re-enable the WebSocket tests"
4. Agent proceeded to implement the opposite of the user's choice

### Expected Behavior
- Agent should have acknowledged the choice to keep tests disabled
- No changes should have been made to the test files
- Development should have proceeded to other functionality

### Actual Behavior
- Agent incorrectly interpreted the selection as a request to re-enable tests
- Proceeded to modify test files against user's explicit choice
- Created multiple test runs that the user specifically wanted to avoid

### Impact
- User time wasted fixing unwanted changes
- Multiple unnecessary test runs triggered
- Trust in agent's decision-making capabilities reduced
- Development workflow disrupted

### Additional Context
This appears to be a fundamental issue in the agent's logic where it's either:
1. Not properly parsing numbered choices
2. Has an issue in its choice-tracking mechanism
3. Suffering from context loss between interactions

### Suggested Fix
- Implement strict validation of user selections against presented options
- Add confirmation step before taking actions that contradict explicit user choices
- Improve option tracking to prevent logic inversions
